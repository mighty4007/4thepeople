1)Scalling:

	vertical : insted of more morvers we will have one big servier which can hold multile services like (which can controll DB,web..etc)
		con: limited when its getting bigger, single point of failure
		pro : less maintanance

	Horizantal: multiple servers with load balancing
		con : high maintanance, will workout with stateless
		pro : SOF can be addresed,can be scale infinatly

which one to go : chosse the simplest architecture that meets your project traffic requirements but no simpler

2) Failover stratergies:

	what kind of serviers are their
		on premize (company owned)
		cloud services(amezon ec2, google compute engine, azure VMs)
		Fully managed "serverless" services (i.e., amezon lambda,kinesis,athena)

	Failover servers
		Cold Standby : keeping the backup in tapes/dsks/..etc (periodic) . if DB crashers backup will be restored to anpther server and traffic pointer to new
			con : downtime till new server ready, back up may fail, data loss during fail

		Warm sandby : replication service whic can be replicated in real time
			con : tiny window of data loss

		Hot standby : insted of replication webserver will wire data in multiple dbs simultaneosly. fit in horizontal scale
			con : more resource utilization

3) scaling databases
	Horizontal scale: Sharding
     	web poining to multiple shard dbs with their backups
