Docker
	--> Docker is container technology. a tool to crating and managing containers
	--> Support for containers is biuld into modern OS
	--> Docker sinplifies the creation and management of such containers
	--> https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ : docker setup
	--> if ur system not supporting docker we can have web version https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ÃŸ

Container
	--> A standardized unit of sw. a pkg of code and its dependencies to run that code(ex: nodejs code+ nodejs runtime)
	--> the same container always yields the exact same application and execution behaviout no matter where or by whome it might get executed
	--> it will solve the environmental issues and clashing tools/version btw different projects

VM vs Containers
	--> we intsall VM on top of host OS. it can pack app+dependency tools+ virtual OS
	--> every VM have virtual OS due to this lot of space and hardware utilization
	--> VM Pros
		--> separated env
		--> Environment-specific configurations are possible
		--> env. config can be shared and re produced reliably
	--> Vm Cons
		--> Redundant duplication,waste of space
		--> slow performance boot time high
		--> reproducing on other compuer/server is possible but may still be tricky
	--> Container Uses OS Built-in/Emulated Container Support in host OS which can eleminate the virtual OS packing 
	--> Docker engine will be on top of OS which can utilise container support from host OS
	--> only APP and dependecies can be paked to container
	--> container pros
		--> low impact on OS very fast minimal disk utilization
		--> sharing re-building easy
		--> encapsulate apps/env insted of whole machine

DockerTools
	--> Docker Engine : its require to run docker
	--> Docker Desktop(incl. Daemon & CLI): creation 
	--> Docker Hub : its service that can help host containers in clusters,DC and AZs
	--> Docer Compose : managing complex multi container projects easily
	--> Kubernetes : managing containers

Sample Docker file commands
	--> FROM NODE:14 --> Create nodejs image
	--> RUN npm install
	--> CMD [ "node", "app.mjs" ] to run application
	--> docker build . : to build docker image from current directory
	--> docker run -p 3000:3000 <docker image ID> : after buld docker image to run that we can use this command 
	--> Docker ps : to list out the services running
	--> Docker stop <service name> : to shutdown service
	--> npm config set strict-ssl false : if we are encountering certificate issue

Images vs Containers
	--> images will be template/blue print for the containers. containes code +required tools/run times
	--> we can create multiple cotainer based on the image
	--> so container will be concrete instance of such an image

pre-build images
	-> pre-build images help us to create containers to run our appications
		--> Ex : Docker run node : it will provide node container by downloading from docker hub
		--> docker ps -a will show the container which is areated above
			--> -a : all the containers created by docker
		--> docker run -it node : this command used to interact with node means we can run node commands here

Own Build Images
	--> COPY . . first dot represent the current directory of docker file second is destination container its like images/container file system 
	--> COPY . /myapp : it will create myapp folder with in image 
	--> WORKDIR /myapp : if mention this COPY . ./ will copy to myapp directory
	--> the differance between RUN and CMD is run to be used while building image it self it can run where as CMD can be executed while container starts
		since doctfile having image info its good to us CMD for running server for dependencies we can use RUN
		-->  we can pass cmd as arry CMD node server.js can be written as CMD ["node","server.js"]. usually CMD will be last statement
		--> before that we need to expose port of service in docker file using EXPOSE <port> command
	--> docker run -p 3000:80 7eb4de93187e 3000 is for to container port where as 80 is docker exposed port

Images
	--> images are immutable
	--> usually we need to rebuilt image if any change in code . as source will be copied to Docker file system which is isolated from our source code
	--> to compensate those rebuild. docker will only update the changed data rather than do everthing while rebuiding image
	--> Every instruction in Docker file represents layer. its called layer architecture.docker maitains cache for each layer
	--> container will create layer on top of the image layer which is read and write
	--> when we rebuild image it will use cache if no change source code. if we have any change only that instruction layer invoke others use cache
	--> if change detected in one layer next layers onwards it will reexecuted even no change in that layer
	--> so its always good practice to give optimized ordered instuctions in docker file to minimize the reexecution
	--> images can be shared by pushing to dockerhub or private registry. below are the steps for sharing
		--> we need to signup for dockerhub/private regestry
		--> it can be private public and official images
		--> create repository in dockerhub 
		--> docker build -t acamind/node-hello-world / docker tag existingname:existingtag academind/node-hello-world
		--> docker login : give username and password to login
		--> docker push acamind/node-hello-world
		--> docker pull acamind/node-hello-world

Imp commands
	--> docker start <name/imageid> will bring container up
	--> run vs start
		--> run willnot allow to enter further commands where as start will not block terminal
		its due to run will run in detached mode by default . we can run the run in detached mode
		--> run in detacched mode docker run -p 8000:80 -d <imageID>
		--> we can use docker log -f "containername" to attach again
		--> we can make start as attached by adding -a
		--> docker run -i -t <image> will run in interactive mode i: interactive means we can supply input params. t : allocate tty
			--> we can combine i and t as -it
		--> docker rm <container1> <con2> : to remove containers
		--> docker rmi <image1> <img2> : to remove images (in order to remove image first we need to remove its containers irrespective of its run status)
		--> docker image prune  : to remove all the unused images
		--> docker run --rm -d -p 3000:80 <imageID> : as we used --rm it will remove container as soon as container stop
		--> docker image inspect b1c0c5c84200 : gives details of that image
		--> docker cp <path/filename/.> <containerid>/mypathfolder : to copy files from local to container .if no folder exist in container it will create one
		--> docker cp  <containerid>/mypathfolder <path/filename/.> : copy from container to local
		--> docker run --name myname <Image> : to run container with our name 
		--> name:tag  : usually tag we use for version
		--> build image with our own name and tag
			--> docker build -t myapp:version1 .
